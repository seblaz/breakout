    Breakout Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden

    Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
    Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
    player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
    with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
    values by deflecting a ball back at them.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.

local main

--[[
    Called just once at the beginning of the game; used to set up
    game objects, variables, etc. and prepare the game world.
]]
function love.load()
    -- set love's default filter to "nearest-neighbor", which essentially
    -- means there will be no filtering of pixels (blurriness), which is
    -- important for a nice crisp, 2D look
    love.graphics.setDefaultFilter('nearest', 'nearest')

    -- Our game, require it after the setDefaultFilter
    main = require 'src/Main'()

    -- a table we'll use to keep track of which keys have been pressed this
    -- frame, to get around the fact that LÃ–VE's default callback won't let us
    -- test for input from within other functions
    love.keyboard.keysPressed = {}
end

--[[
    Called whenever we change the dimensions of our window, as by dragging
    out its bottom corner, for example.
]]
function love.resize(...)
    main:resize(...)
end

--[[
    Called every frame, passing in `dt` since the last frame. `dt`
    is short for `deltaTime` and is measured in seconds. Multiplying
    this by any changes we wish to make in our game will allow our
    game to perform consistently across all hardware; otherwise, any
    changes we make will be applied as fast as possible and will vary
    across system hardware.
]]
function love.update(dt)
    main:update(dt)

    -- reset keys pressed
    love.keyboard.keysPressed = {}
end

--[[
    A callback that processes key strokes as they happen, just the once.
    Does not account for keys that are held down, which is handled by a
    separate function (`love.keyboard.isDown`). Useful for when we want
    things to happen right away, just once, like when we want to quit.
]]
function love.keypressed(key)
    -- add to our table of keys pressed this frame
    love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] = true
end

--[[
    A custom function that will let us test for individual keystrokes outside
    of the default `love.keypressed` callback, since we can't call that logic
    elsewhere by default.
]]
function love.keyboard.wasPressed(key)
    if love.keyboard.keysPressed[key] then
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end

--[[
    Called each frame after update; is responsible simply for
    drawing all of our game objects and more to the screen.
]]
function love.draw()
    main:render()
end
